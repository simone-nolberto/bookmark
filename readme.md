This is the repo where you will find the execution for technical test I received. 
Some simple instructions to verify that everything works (even if only in local state): 

- once you will have written the key word, through the console check if it log the array;
  - if it is logged, back to the input and modify it, in order to see the results in page;

- results will be filtered showing only those books whose title contains "userInput", both as it is written and with first capital letter;
  - this should allows the results to be a little bit more correct;

- you will be able to navigate through books results, and see their details;
  - in the specific page for the book you select, you will find some details and the button to save it in your favorites;

- to see you favorite books, you will have to come back to the home screen, where you can find a button; 
  - by clicking on it, you will be routed to the correct page, where you will find the books you saved;
  - here you will the possibility to remove them (but, to see the result of this operation, you will have to exit and return in "favorites" page );
